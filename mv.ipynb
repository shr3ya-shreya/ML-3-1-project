Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Much more fun than than Palazzo Volpi, though just as diseased, this movie is a true gem of squalor. One cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz. Here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized. The characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer, creating a \\\"phenomenon of a phenomenon\\\" effect which makes this movie a piece of art.\",\n          \"Actually I'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American University. But nobody in USA has heard of it, which is a real shame! The dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad. They are stuck together on a long bus trip--someplace most of us have been!! But I never had one like this!! <br /><br />My favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral. Then the man & woman sneak off for some Lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing! Just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way--the consumptive starts hacking & they realize everybody is watching!! Talk about surprised! But...you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny! When you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did! Serb humor at it's best!\",\n          \"Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.<br /><br />Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.<br /><br />Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. She endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts come along for her. She really deserves it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LBoJvPt6mjTC","outputId":"f288f2fa-2a35-4365-c7a7-c7c6e822f4c4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795571791,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":103,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 50000 entries, 0 to 49999\n","Data columns (total 2 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------     --------------  ----- \n"," 0   review     50000 non-null  object\n"," 1   sentiment  50000 non-null  object\n","dtypes: object(2)\n","memory usage: 781.4+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","data.duplicated().sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lip6pkEjmnwl","outputId":"295d1f3f-af75-4631-f471-a0e60816e55d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795574302,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":563,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["np.int64(418)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = data.drop_duplicates(subset=['review']).reset_index(drop=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"TXnC9REJqksS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795575926,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":261,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data['sentiment'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"MjkrYamZqo-z","outputId":"113fe737-1a9e-4ec9-8ea9-dc35eff911ca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795576755,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":74,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["sentiment\n","positive    24884\n","negative    24698\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>sentiment</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>positive</th>\n","      <td>24884</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>negative</th>\n","      <td>24698</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"metadata":{"id":"lYLTIJfLqr29","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795578540,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":66,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_dist = [\n","    len(data[data['sentiment']=='positive']),\n","    len(data[data['sentiment']=='negative'])\n","]\n","labels = ['Positive','Negative']\n","plt.pie(data_dist, labels = labels)\n","plt.show"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":575},"id":"Pmc_8d0YquCD","outputId":"65fb5b1e-348a-4195-aeca-9571145f04b4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795580060,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":201,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<function matplotlib.pyplot.show(close=None, block=None)>"],"text/html":["<div style=\"max-width:800px;

This movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want that you can rent something from the \\\"Adult\\\" section. OK?<br /><br />I can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whatever.<br /><br />2/10\",\n          \"Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, battle of good and evil -- all with a small budget, child actors, and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"CleanedText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49578,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"since frame number know good guy suit necktie doomed luck sorte nula believes music car radio dubious talk best friend company associate taking parts unknown desert road alberto wished simply left alone take flight abroad next day well someone left guessing film goes long way find short closing scene man hearing music cab airport between number lucky people found different ways story dying born others falling harrowing distress time really doomed he film sort oneman show director fernando fragata left sound recording special effects other competent people typically reject portuguese films due sound problems unclear speech recording must go searching topics criticize time car crash this spoilers film clever that makes great scene apparently done cheap equipment us studios take notice may spare dollar two hiding competent portuguese directors rest done fragata script dialogue camera work editing part dialogue adlibbed must congratulated acting direction casting mostly inexperienced actors large number nonspeaking parts credited people used music video clip making of used extensively films promotional trailer cast dozen actors actresses ten relevant persons huge number relationships revealed stepbystep thrilling suspenseful way reminiscent best genre authors alfred hitchcock qv claude chabrol qv come mind catandmouse play director public nature charactersi recommend thriller comedy portuguese language speakers and film gets decent translation colloquial dialogue anyone abroad enjoys genres\",\n          \"dentist really good thriller pretty disturbing think agree chances running psycho dentist much bigger running monsters vampires zombies thats exactly movie scary film probably think dentist times whether capable thingsyou better pray wife cheat him thats story about respected dentist la snaps finds wife cheating poolboy must greatest profession world way poolboys always take advantage housewives husband work dentist dr feinstone thing taking revenge cant concentrate patients anymore couple get hurt things made easier dentist chased annoying taxcontroller curious cop suspicious staff member his one point dr feinstone cant take anymore wife everyone comes near him dentist written directed brian yuzna cowritten stuart gordon take recommendation itself persons already gave us great horror movies personal favorites mine like reanimator beyond society dentist succeed bring entertaining chilling thriller film came right time actually decade brought us many great horror films far saying masterpiece nice change corbin bensen great dentist obsessed hygiene remember mostly comedy drama actor sure handle psychotic character rest cast good work too woman plays feinstones wife really attractive also great see ken foree acting again actor time favorite movie dawn dead plays cop film yuzna casted beyond too years ago thank that recommend movie everyone if weak stomach advise skip it watch it enjoy much disgustedbut thats extra reason think since really freaked watching film great topic handle genre yuzna great way bad film followed completely unnecessary sequel humble opinion dentist\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","data.sample(20)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":676},"id":"PrGRSBZRr0T4","outputId":"3bc6b000-12e0-49ec-d5d0-ed23d1fd13f9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760795630032,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"Shreya Reddy","userId":"15167704491972867359"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  review sentiment  \\\n","28910  Stupid horror film about five 20 somethings (3...  negative   \n","42953  I have in the past loved Tim Burton.

What they don't know is Dr. Chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods. They use their body parts for some experiments...or something. Also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavage.<br /><br />Pretty desperate. The story is confusing and boring; the gore is laughably fake; Dr. Chopper and his assistants overact TERRIBLY; there's some dreadful black \\\"humor\\\" in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them.<br /><br />This was pretty insulting. There are a few pluses. A twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is OK as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has his moments as Nicholas. Best of all is Chesley Crisp as Jessica--she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well-acted and interesting. Unfortunately the dialogue wasn't really there for them. I'm giving it a 4 for their performances--but nothing else here is worth mentioning. Hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them.\",\n          \"Trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect. The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.\",\n          \"Some people don't appreciate the magical elements in ROS,but they are what sets this series apart, that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour--not anachronistic feathered caps,multi-coloured tights and plate armour!<br /><br />But I am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article. Um, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to do Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yup, I agree and Michael might well agree too that leaving ROS was not a good move--but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then Dynasty with its megabucks paychecks....\"\n
